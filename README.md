## Description

SocialSync is an application that enables users to create and organize social events such as potlucks, camping trips, reunions, and more. Additionally, it provides real-time weather information for the eventâ€™s location, helping users plan effectively. We developed this idea to enhance community engagement and simplify the process of organizing gatherings for friends and family. By consolidating all the necessary event details, including weather updates, this application offers a convenient, all-in-one solution for event planning.

## Features

- User Authentication: Signup, login, and profile management with JWT authentication.
- Event Creation: Users can create and manage their events.
- Event Browsing: Discover and browse upcoming events in the community.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI for optimal user experience across devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the project:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/socialsync.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd SocialSync
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    - For the client:

    ```
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

    - For the server:

    ```
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up environment variables: In the server directory, create a .env file and add your PostgreSQL and JWT secret key:

    ```
    DB_NAME='database_name'
    DB_USER='postgres'
    DB_PASSWORD='your_password'
    JWT_SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key'
    ```

5. Set up the database: Run the following commands in the server directory to seed the database:

    ```
    npm run seed
    ```

6. Build the dist folder: Run the following commands in the client directory and in the server directory:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

7. Run the development server: Start both the client and server applications:

    ```
    npm run start:dev
    ```

SocialSync should now be running locally at http://localhost:3000.
